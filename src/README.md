# Assignment 1.09: PC Equipment and Updated Combat

## Description

In this assignment, we began interacting with items in dungeon and updated
the combat as well. Now, the player can pick up items, equip them, drop them,
and expunge them. We also updated the combat. Now, monsters do not attack each
other. Also, each hit isn't an instant kill. Instead, each hit does damage
to the overall hitpoints of the character. Once the hitpoints falls below zero,
then the character is considered dead.

## Usage

Same usage as always:
`make`
`./generate_dungeon`
